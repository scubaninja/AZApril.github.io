Hello Everyone!

I have been mulling over what to do with my blog for over the past couple of years. For the last few years of my life, I was asked/measured/required to blog for https://devblogs.microsoft.com. Leading me to prioritize my work blogging, really unsure of what to do with my personal site. 

For the time being, I will working through migrating my blog off of WordPress and onto GitHub Pages using Jekyll. I will be also adding in some cool features around embedding my talks, decks and some other cool stuff. Watch this space for my next update!
